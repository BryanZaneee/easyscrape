# Easy Scrape

A terminal-first web scraper that converts pages into clean, AI-friendly
Markdown files. Reads only the article body, normalizes noisy markup,
extracts useful stats into YAML frontmatter, writes one `.md` per page, and
ends every run with a token summary so you can compare collections over time.

The cleanup pipeline, sidebar discovery, and category browsing are organized
as named pipeline steps inside the `easy_scrape` package, designed to be
extended with adapters for additional sites. The first included adapter targets
[Fextralife](https://fextralife.com) wiki subdomains (`*.wiki.fextralife.com`)
and is tested on Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Bloodborne. Other sites with a
single article-body container are usable today via `--base` plus `--no-clean`,
or by adding a site-specific cleanup module.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pick your source

Use `--base` to point at any site you want to scrape. The bundled adapter is
optimized for Fextralife subdomains — for example:

```
https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com           (Dark Souls — default)
https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com          (Dark Souls 2)
https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com          (Dark Souls 3)
https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com           (Elden Ring)
https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com          (Bloodborne)
https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com   (Sekiro)
https://nioh2.wiki.fextralife.com               (Nioh 2)
https://lordsofthefallen.wiki.fextralife.com    (Lords of the Fallen)
```

For other sites: open the page in a browser, copy the base URL (everything
before the first `/<page>` segment), and pass it via `--base`. If the site does
not match the bundled cleanup rules, pass `--no-clean` to get raw markdownify
output, or add a site-specific cleanup module under `easy_scrape/`.

## Workflow

### Interactive category scrape

Run the script with no flags to open the interactive picker:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py
```

The TUI opens with an `easyScrape` banner, light rain/cloud effects, and a
source picker. It lets you choose the default Fextralife wiki or enter a custom
base URL, discovers the site's sidebar categories, and gives you a multi-select
category list. Before scraping starts, it asks where to write the files with an
in-terminal folder browser. The default action writes to
`~/Desktop/easy_scrape_output`; you can also browse folders, use the current
folder, create a named child folder, or type an existing path directly. Use
`up/down` or `j/k` to move, `space` to toggle categories, the `All` row or `a`
to select all, `n` to clear categories or name a new output folder, `/` to type
an output path, `backspace` to browse to a parent folder, `~` for home, `d` for
Desktop, `enter` to continue, and `q` to quit.
Mouse-wheel events are ignored by the TUI so scrolling does not disturb the
weather effects or selection.

If the target site has no discoverable sidebar categories, the TUI offers
fallback scrape choices: scrape via `/sitemap.xml` or scrape only the entered
URL.

You can also force the picker while still supplying defaults:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py \
  --interactive \
  --base https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com \
  --out elden-ring
```

After category and output-folder selection, the scrape uses the same organized
category folders and animated progress dashboard as scripted category mode.

### Scripted workflow

#### 1. Discover what categories the site has

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py --base <site-url> --discover
```

This prints the site's sidebar nav as a flat list of category names. For
Fextralife wikis that is typically 60-100 entries like `Weapons`, `Armor`,
`Bosses`, `Spells`, `Rings`, etc. Pick the ones you want.

#### 2. Preview a category before committing

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py --base <site-url> --category Weapons --list-only
```

Prints the URLs that would be downloaded — sanity-check that the hub gives
clean results (some hubs are sub-indexes that link to other hubs rather
than to individual pages).

#### 3. Scrape into organized folders

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py \
  --base <site-url> \
  --category Weapons \
  --category Armor \
  --category Bosses
```

Each category becomes its own subfolder under the chosen output root. By
default, that root is `~/Desktop/easy_scrape_output`:

```
~/Desktop/easy_scrape_output/
├── Weapons/
├── Armor/
└── Bosses/
```

Clean-mode output is the default. It adds YAML frontmatter with the page title,
source URL, category, and best-effort table stats; removes inline links while
preserving their visible text; strips footer navigation tables and sidebar leak
links; promotes useful image alt text into table labels; normalizes repeated
heading patterns; and drops placeholder sections such as `N/A` notes. The
included cleanup rules are tuned for Fextralife markup; other sites should use
`--no-clean` until a matching adapter exists.

Every scrape run ends with a token summary for the final Markdown collection:
Markdown file count, bytes, characters, words, estimated tokens, a compact
final report with total files/tokens/words/chars, and the largest files. The
token estimate is intentionally stable and dependency-free (`~4 chars/token`),
so you can compare different scrape versions and category collections over time.

Interactive terminal runs then open a folder stats browser by default. Use the
arrow keys to move through each extracted output folder and see its Markdown
file count, file size, characters, words, estimated tokens, and largest files.
Press `enter` or the right arrow to open the selected folder's contents list in
the UI, the left arrow or backspace to return to folders, and `o` to reveal the
selected folder in your OS file manager. Scripted runs can opt in with
`--browse-stats`; interactive runs can skip it with `--no-browse-stats`.

Interactive terminal scrapes render a structured dashboard with weather effects
inspired by the sibling `weathr` app: drifting clouds, rain, splashes, and rare
lightning. The dashboard shows the active mode, current stage, output path,
page progress, current URL, saved/skipped/failed counts, elapsed time, and
recent page results. It automatically falls back to plain line-by-line logs
when stdout is redirected, when the terminal is too small, or when you pass
`--no-tui`.

TUI controls are intentionally visual-only: `?` or `h` toggles help, `p`
pauses/resumes the weather effects while scraping continues, `q` leaves the TUI
and continues the scrape with plain logs, and `Ctrl-C` still cancels the scrape.

### Scrape maps or other page images

By default, the scraper stays text-only. Add `--download-images` when you want
meaningful article images downloaded for AI workflows:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py \
  --base https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com \
  --category Maps \
  --download-images
```

This keeps stat/table icons as text labels, but downloads real content images
from the page into `<out>/assets/<page-slug>/` and writes relative image
references into the Markdown, such as:

```md
![Northern Undead Asylum](../assets/Maps/Northern_AsylumMapV1.jpg)
```

### Or scrape everything (sitemap mode)

If you want every page on a site, pass `--base` and drop `--category`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py --base <site-url>
```

This reads `/sitemap.xml` and saves every page into a single flat folder.
Optionally narrow with `--filter '<regex>'`.

### Compare token size for an existing collection

Use `--stats-only` to inspect an existing output folder without fetching pages:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py --out output --stats-only
```

This is useful after cleanup iterations or when comparing source-specific
collections for an AI agent knowledge base.

## Iterating on cleanup

Use `--cache-dir` while improving cleanup rules or testing a scrape shape. The
first run stores raw HTML; later runs replay from disk and avoid refetching the
same URLs.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scrape.py \
  --base https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com \
  --category Bosses \
  --cache-dir .cache/html \
  --overwrite
```

Use `--no-clean` when you need the older raw-ish markdownify output with a
simple title/source header and no YAML frontmatter — useful when scraping a
site that the bundled cleanup rules don't yet target.

## Worked example: Elden Ring

```bash
# 1. See what categories exist
.venv/bin/python scrape.py \
  --base https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com --discover

# 2. Pick categories from the printed list, then scrape
.venv/bin/python scrape.py \
  --base https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com \
  --out elden-ring \
  --category Weapons \
  --category Armor \
  --category Bosses \
  --category Sorceries \
  --category Incantations \
  --category Ashes+of+War
```

| `--no-clean`   | off                                     | skip cleanup/YAML frontmatter pass       |

Category names with spaces use the URL form: `Ashes+of+War`, `Boss+Souls`, etc.
Use the names exactly as shown by `--discover`.

## How it works

1. **Choose URL source** — the no-arg interactive picker discovers categories
   first; scripted modes use `/sitemap.xml` for the whole site, or a hub page
   (e.g. `/Weapons`) plus its in-content links for category mode.
2. **Fetch the page** with browser-like headers; auto-retry on 429/5xx.
3. **Fetch or replay** the raw HTML, optionally using `--cache-dir`.
4. **Extract** the article body container (currently `#wiki-content-block`,
   used by the bundled Fextralife adapter).
5. **Clean** site-specific noise via the named cleanup pipeline: expand
   rowspans, preserve useful image alt text, optionally download content
   images, drop banner/footer/sidebar clutter, unwrap inline links, collapse
   empty table columns, normalize headings, and remove placeholder sections.
6. **Extract frontmatter** from the first page-owned stat table when possible.
7. **Convert** HTML to Markdown via `markdownify`.
8. **Save** as `<slug>.md` with YAML frontmatter in clean mode.
9. **Render progress** through the optional interactive dashboard TUI when
   stdout is a real terminal; otherwise preserve plain logs.
10. **Summarize tokens** for the final Markdown collection using a stable
   `~4 chars/token` estimate.
11. **Browse folder stats** after interactive scrapes so users can compare
   extracted folders and open their contents without leaving the terminal flow.
12. **Politeness:** 1s default delay, retry/backoff, skip files that
   already exist (so you can interrupt and resume safely).

## Extending to other sites

The package is split so that adding a new site adapter is mostly a matter of
extending the cleanup pipeline:

- `easy_scrape/constants.py` — the article-body selector and default base URL
- `easy_scrape/cleanup.py` — named pipeline steps that run in order
- `easy_scrape/fetching.py` — sidebar discovery and URL extraction
- `easy_scrape/pipeline.py` — `ScrapeOptions` / `ScrapeResult` orchestration

Until a site has a matching cleanup module, `--no-clean` produces a usable
markdownify dump with a simple title/source header.

## Tests

Fixture-based regression tests cover the cleanup behavior for representative
pages, plus unit tests for the runners, stats layer, and TUI primitives:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest
```

## Quirks to know

- Some hubs are **meta-indexes** that link to other hubs rather than to
  individual pages. For example, on Dark Souls 1, `/Magic` links to
  `Pyromancies`, `Sorceries`, `Miracles` instead of listing spells
  directly. Use `--list-only` to spot this, then point at the leaf hubs.
- Hub pages can still include some "noise" links (related categories, helper
  pages). Clean mode removes the common sidebar/footer patterns, but use
  `--list-only` before large runs when a category may be a meta-index.
- The bundled `#wiki-content-block` selector is the Fextralife article-body
  container, so the same adapter works across every Fextralife wiki without
  per-game tweaks. Other sites need either `--no-clean` or a site-specific
  cleanup module.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For anything larger than a fix, open an issue first
so the change can be discussed.

Run the suite before opening a PR:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest
```

Cleanup changes need a fixture. Add the raw HTML under `tests/fixtures/` and a
case in `tests/test_cleanup.py` rather than asserting against a live fetch, so
the suite stays offline and the site cannot break it.

A new site adapter is a cleanup module plus a selector; see
[Extending to other sites](#extending-to-other-sites) for the four files
involved.
